## Welcome

The Dutch Functional Programming Day *(also known as the FP Dag)* is
an annual gathering of researchers, students, and practitioners
sharing a common interest in functional programming. The day features
talks that cover the latest advances in research, teaching, and
applications in functional programming in the broadest sense. Coffee
and lunch breaks provide ample opportunity for networking with your
colleagues and meeting new people. Experts and newcomers to the field
are equally welcome.
